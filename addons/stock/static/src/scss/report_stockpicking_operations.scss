 * Before this PR, col-auto was the closest thing to flex box support.
 * However, an issue arised at the time of testing: when one of the
 * fields has long words in it, the spacing fails miserably
 * (it becomes very elongated on the vertical axis). The only way
 * to remove this effect and also with wkhtmltopdf outdated CSS support
 * is to add min-width so that it forces the fields to have a readable
 * width for this specific report. It can also be seen that this solution is
 * suggested in base styling for reports.
